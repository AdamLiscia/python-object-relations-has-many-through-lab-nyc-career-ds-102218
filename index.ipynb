    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab we are going to work on creating a **has many through** relationship. Until this point, our relationships have been pretty straight forward. But what if we are dealing with a relationship where both classes could have many of the other class. For example, we could talk about a `Doctor` and a `Patient`. We know just about everyone has more than one doctor, or they could potentially. We have eye doctors, teeth doctors (otherwise known as dentists), general practitioners (doctor you see for regular checkups), and so on. And doctors will have more than one patient if they want to have a thriving practice. Since this is **many to many** relationship, we have to add in a third class. Dun dun dun! Don't worry -- we'll figure this out together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ask ourselves what doctors and patients have in common. They both are usually running late? Well yes, but it doesn't seem like that would help explain their connection. What about they both have an appointment? Let's say we have doctor Danielle and patient Patrick. Doctor Danielle **has one** appointment with a patient Patrick and patient Patrick also **has one** appointment with doctor Danielle. We can also say that this appointment **belongs to** both a the doctor and the patient. This sounds like the right connection! Pretty neat, right? Let's get started translating something like this into code."
